a)	This algorithm looks through both list I and j and checks whether I is not equal to j and whether list[i] is equal to list [j] if they are, then the list has a duplicate within it and the code returns true.  If there is not a duplicate, then it will return false and end the procedure.

b)	Quadratic will have the worst running time because the algorithm must check data in each list to see if there is a duplicate this will quadruple the amount of time that it will take for the program to finish.


c)	J

d)	I


e)	I

f)	O (n log n)


g)	O(n)

h)	The faster algorithm to run would be O (n log n) because O(n) is linear meaning that the function is proportional to the size of the list. Whereas O (n log n) will only take a few iterations because it halves the list, instead of checking each item in the list against each other.
